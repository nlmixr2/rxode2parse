# rxode2parse

`rxode2parse` was a package supporting `rxode2` language parsing.  It
was created to support a CRAN request to break out `rxode2` into
smaller packages to reduce compiling time.

Now, CRAN has requested that we merge this package back to `rxode2`.
Therefore this has been archived.

The 'rxode2' package development is located at:

https://github.com/nlmixr2/rxode2
